# Cospectral analysis between soil respiration component and biophysical drivers
This repository includes the code and data associated with the project to investigate the biophysical and abiotic drivers of soil respiration components (i.e., autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration) between 2022 and 2024 in Davy Crockett National Forest, TX, USA.
