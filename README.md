# Cospectral analysis between soil respiration component and biophysical drivers
This repository includes the code and data associated with a manuscript, "The use of newly assimilated photosynthates by soil autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration on a diurnal scale".

The manuscript is accepted by Biogeosciences, and the preprint is available as: https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2025-2849.

This project is to investigate the biophysical and abiotic drivers of the soil respiration components in Davy Crockett National Forest, TX, USA.
